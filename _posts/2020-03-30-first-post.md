This is my first post, how exciting!

Technically, it's not my first post ever, but it's the start of this new site.
After trying to get something started in WordPress for so many times,
I'm taking a completely different route now.

The essential starting point was Aaron Parker's blog. Aaron is a Citrix CTP, and a valued member of the community for a long time. He decided to migrate his WordPress site to Jekyll. I didn't have anything to migrate from, but I was inspired.

##### So, why Jekyll?
It's free, it's fast, and it integrates with GitHub. Others have written a ton of blog posts on this already. Just check out the post on Aaron's site [here](https://stealthpuppy.com/goodbye-wordpess-hello-jekyll/#undefined), it's an excellent resource.

##### Sounds complicated?
Not really, I decided to go for the KISS route. I went with the Beautiful Jekyll project by Dean Attali. Demo and more information [here](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/). That's it. I'm still learning the ins and outs, but I sure like it so far.
